- Trello Board: https://trello.com/b/zjN52Nde/wheel-of-wdi
- GitHub: https://github.com/chadchristensen/wheel_of_wdi.git

## Overview
The goal of this project was to use our skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to
create a game that required manipulation of the DOM.  I chose a variation of Wheel of Fortune based on
phrases and people related to the Web Development Immersive program.
